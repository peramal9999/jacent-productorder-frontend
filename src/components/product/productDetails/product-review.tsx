            'This is my second of these jumpers - I love how light and warm they are especially under a jacket. They breathe well and dont require regular washing. I have gently handwashed my old one in warm water once or twice without any issues. The sleeves are flattering and I don\'t find the wool itchy, it softens up after a couple of wears. I sized down and it\'s still a lovely oversized fit.\n',
